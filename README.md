# Currency-Converter-v1.0
A rudimentary currency converter that can help with currency conversion (pretty self explanatory)
When it asks for currencies, please do put in short forms that are correct such as usd is for us dollars and cad for canadian dollars. 
Abbreviations do not need to be capitalized as the code automatically does so. 
Do keep in mind that not all currencies are supported, future updates will be published. 

Enjoy :)
